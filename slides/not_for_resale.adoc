= Red Hat Not For Resale (NFR) Subscriptions

* As a partner you have access to all of Red Hat software for development purposes at no cost to you.  This is what we refer to as *"Not For Resale (NFR) Subscriptions"*.  In order to access and manage all of your NFR subscription needs, please visit the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/partners/Technical_Resources[Red Hat Connect for Business Partners^] website.  The following resources can be accessed via this partner webpage.  The following document also provides information on this process: link:https://www.redhat.com/files/other/partners/Howtoguide-createanewNFR.pdf[How to request a new NFR subsctiption]

* After you have been granted access to NFR Subscriptions, please follow these instructions to access and leverage the subscription.  The example below is for Red Hat Openstack however it applies to any NFR software provided by Red Hat.

[start=1]
. Login to the server as the root user
. Use the subscription-manager command to register your userid to the machine:

....
# subscription-manager register --username <your_username> --password <your_password>
....

[start=3]
. Use subscription-manager to list all available subscriptions and locate the one for the NFR you've requested.  In the example below, I have one for the "Openstack Platform"
....
# subscription-manager list --available &> all_subscriptions.txt
....
This will create a file named *all_subscriptions.txt*.  Edit this file and search for the product.  Below is what I get for the NFR product I have access to.  Take note of the *"Pool ID"* conveyed in the text below.
